non blocking version of the Teensy Ethernet library, modified by Paul Stoffregen and Tom Magnier


This is a version of the Ethernet library which is based on this (non merged) pull-request: https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Ethernet/pull/13/commits/41b51826e032e2d8eb33bb2ff645b287ca566d9b

Additionally, I have manually patched all the changes since Version 1.1.1 of this library (which was the base for Tom Magnier's pull request) which have been made by Paul Stoffregen to the Ethernet library until 3rd of November 2018.
